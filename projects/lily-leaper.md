## Lessons Learned
  - Making games sounds fun, but making games fun is not so fun
  - Art and sound can contribute a lot to how fun a game is
  - Unity Version Control is okay, but when it breaks, it is very hard to recover
  - Don't overwork you designers by trying to implement a lot of new features
  - Overall, Game Design is not as easy as it looks

## Future Development

  - Create more collectible
